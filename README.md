[Abstract Data Types](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type) in TypeScript.

Also an exercise in figuring out best practice when distributing a TypeScript project via npm.

Concerns so far:

* Would it be good to have an `.npmignore` containing `src/*`, `Makefile`, etc.?
* Everything is packaged up in `index.js`; would that still be a good idea if it was a big project?
